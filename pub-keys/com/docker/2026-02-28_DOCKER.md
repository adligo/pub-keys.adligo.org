- [Docker Desktop Windows Install](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

```
wget -O DockerDesktopInstaller.exe https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe
sha512sum DockerDesktopInstaller.exe > DockerDesktopInstaller.exe.sha512
cat DockerDesktopInstaller.exe.sha512
diff DockerDesktopInstaller.exe.sha512 
```

Note Docker doesn't seem to version number the installer, but I have Docker Desktop Installers of various sizes on my machine so they are clearly updating it from time to time.  You should contribute to this project and commit the sha512 checksums that you are seeing!
