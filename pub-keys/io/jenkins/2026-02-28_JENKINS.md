We usually prefer the war because we can run it directly or create our own 
Docker image and include it.  When we run it on bare metal we have better control 
over usage of services inside Docker and Web Browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux.

This uses a environment variable FABRICATE_APPS_DIR which is usually /apps on Unix (Linux,Max) or /c/apps on Windows, but is configurable.

```
cd $FABRICATE_APPS_DIR

mkdir jenkins
cd jenkins
wget https://get.jenkins.io/war/2.552/jenkins.war


```

Or

```
cd $FABRICATE_APPS_DIR

mkdir jenkins
cd jenkins
wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.541.2/jenkins.war


```
